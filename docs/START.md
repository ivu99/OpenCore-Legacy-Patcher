# What is OpenCore?

OpenCore is a sophisticated boot loader used to inject and patch data in memory, instead of on disk. This means that we're able to achieve a near-native experience on many unsupported Macs. 

* We recommend viewing the [OpenCore Patcher Terminology Page](./TERMS.md) if you have questions.
* For troubleshooting, join the [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN) and see our [Troubleshooting Page](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## How do I get started?

1. The first step of ensuring whether your model is supported is by checking the [Supported Models](./MODELS.md) page.

2. [Download and build macOS Installer](./INSTALLER.md)
3. [Run the `OpenCore-Patcher.app`](./BUILD.md)
4. [Reboot and boot OpenCore](./BOOT.md)
